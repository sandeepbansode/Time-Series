# Time-Series
Time Series is a certain sequence of data observations that a system collects within specific periods of time — e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly. The specialized models are used to analyze the collected time-series data — describe and interpret them, as well as make certain assumptions based on shifts and odds in the collection.
